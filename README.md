# Description

I created a To-Do List App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, marking as complete or incomplete, and deleting them. The use of Local Storage ensures that the task list persists even if the browser is closed and reopened.

## Installation

To run the To-Do List App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Argwingskodhek/todo-list-app.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Enter a new task in the input box.
3. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
4. Click on a task name to mark it as complete or incomplete.
5. Use the close icon to delete a specific task.
